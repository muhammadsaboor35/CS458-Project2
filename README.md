CS 458 Course Project 2

## Getting Started
This mobile application for COVID-19 Vaccination Survey is written in Flutter on Windows. We have used Android Studio to test the application on an android phone emulator. For IOS, we use a Mac to test the application in Simulator.

## Build and Run
To run the application:
* Install flutter 1.20.2
* Run “flutter pub get”
* Start Android Virtual Device or iPhone Simulator.
* Run “flutter doctor”
* Run “flutter run”
* Install node.
* Install Appium using “npm install -g appium”
* Change directory to the unit-tests directory
* Run “npm i” to install node modules
* Run appium in one terminal
* In another terminal, run “APPIUM_OS=ios node test.js” or “APPIUM_OS=android node test.js” depending on the OS you are going to use.
